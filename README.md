# GNU DDD – GitHub Mirror and Nightly Builds

This project provides:

- A public GitHub mirror of GNU DDD (Data Display Debugger)
- Nightly source tarballs for easier access and testing (todo)

DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers like GDB.

- Nightly tarballs (Releases on this repo): https://github.com/eickeler/ddd-mirror-automation/releases

## What this is


- A convenience mirror of the official DDD source so it’s easy to browse and clone on GitHub.
